	abstract = {Every year, many people suffer from bone fractures because of accidents or diseases. Majority of these fractures are too complicated to be treated with conventional medicine and must be mended surgically using non-degradable metal inserts. Such treatment may result in refusal and protection against stress, but may also require another surgical procedure to get rid of the metal inserts. Additionally, biodegradable metals that can readily erode inside the human body come with certain complications. These aspects prompted scientists to ﬁnd alternatives to metals. Some researchers began to focus on the ﬁeld of polymers which have shown signiﬁcant promise in replacing metals. In orthopaedics, degradable polymeric ﬁxation appliances are being studied to substitute metallic implants, eliminating stress protection and avoiding another implant removal surgery. The new generation of bioabsorbable and degradable polymeric implants are free from toxic and mutagenic effects. Nevertheless, these implants have several issues, including mechanical stiffness and strength limitations, unfavourable tissue responses, foreign body reactions, the late response of degraded tissue, and infection due to crystallinity and hydrophobicity. This review discusses the alternative synthetic polymer implant materials available that can be employed and their properties.},

            The ability to replace or augment diseased body parts totally or partially has improved both the quality and life span of human population. The decline in surgical risks during recent decades has encouraged the development of more complex procedures for prosthetic implantation. Additionally, a variety of extracorporeal devices, such as the heart, lung and blood dialysis machines are used routinely, but these prosthetic elements have several limitations. Hence, research projects are currently underway to overcome the limitations of synthetic materials by developing formulations with varying properties, such as asymptomatic, long‐term function in the human physiological environment, etc., to meet the needs of biomedical surgeons. This review focuses on the several biomaterials corrosion and its measures to prevent corrosion.},

In present scenario the various applications of these biomaterials are still awaited. The most important challenge in using these biomaterials is immune rejection because in current situation the lifetime implants and bone replacement must required biocompatibility along with the biological and mechanical characteristics of the biomaterial used. Till now a number of biomaterials have been discovered and due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability, these are biomaterials are employed significantly in biotherapy and medical science. On the basis of the source, these biomaterials can be grouped into two categories namely natural or synthetic polymers, henceforth they have paid much consideration.},

This new technology is increasingly being adopted in industry to improve the monitoring and efﬁciency of products and organizations. In healthcare, digital human twins ({DHTs}) represent virtual copies of patients, including tissues, organs, and physiological processes. Their application has the potential to transform patient care in the direction of increasingly personalized data-driven medicine. The use of {DHTs} can be integrated with digital twins of healthcare institutions to improve organizational management processes and resource allocation. By modeling the complex multi-omics interactions between genetic and environmental factors, {DHTs} help monitor disease progression and optimize treatment plans. Through digital simulation, {DHT} models enable the selection of the most appropriate molecular therapy and accurate 3D representation for precision surgical planning, together with augmented reality tools. Furthermore, they allow for the development of tailored early diagnosis protocols and new targeted drugs. Furthermore, digital twins can facilitate medical training and education. By creating virtual anatomy and physiology models, medical students can practice procedures, enhance their skills, and improve their understanding of the human body. Overall, digital twins have immense potential to revolutionize healthcare, improving patient care and outcomes, reducing costs, and enhancing medical research and education. However, challenges such as data security, data quality, and data interoperability must be addressed before the widespread adoption of digital twins in healthcare. We aim to propose a narrative review on this hot topic to provide an overview of the potential applications of digital twins to improve treatment and diagnostics, but also of the challenges related to their development and widespread diffusion.},

The first techniques of operative fracture treatment were developed at the end of the 18th and in the beginning of the 19th centuries. The use of cerclage wires to fix fractures was the most frequent fixation at this time. The French Berenger-Feraud (1832–1900) had written the first book on internal fixation. However internal fixation of fractures could not become a practical method before Lister had ensured the safety of open reduction and internal fixation in the treatment of fractures. Lister is not only the father of asepsis; he also used metal wires to fix even closed fractures. The first internal fixation by means of a plate and screws was described by Carl Hansmann in 1858 in Hamburg. Nevertheless, Arbuthnot Lane (1892) and Albin Lambotte (1905) are considered to be the founders of this method, which was further developed by Sherman in the first part of the 20th century.},

	abstract = {Bone replacement might have been practiced for centuries with various materials of natural origin, but had rarely met success until the late 19th century. Nowadays, many different bone substitutes can be used. They can be either derived from biological products such as demineralized bone matrix, platelet-rich plasma, hydroxyapatite, adjunction of growth factors (like bone morphogenetic protein) or synthetic such as calcium sulfate, tri-calcium phosphate ceramics, bioactive glasses, or polymer-based substitutes. All these substitutes are not suitable for every clinical use, and they have to be chosen selectively depending on their purpose. Thus, this review aims to highlight the principal characteristics of the most commonly used bone substitutes and to give some directions concerning their clinical use, as spine fusion, openwedge tibial osteotomy, long bone fracture, oral and maxillofacial surgery, or periodontal treatments. However, the main limitations to bone substitutes use remain the management of large defects and the lack of vascularization in their central part, which is likely to appear following their utilization. In the field of bone tissue engineering, developing porous synthetic substitutes able to support a faster and a wider vascularization within their structure seems to be a promising way of research.},

	abstract = {In the past three decades, ﬁnite element ({FE}) modelling has provided considerable understanding to the area of musculoskeletal biomechanics. However, most of this understanding has been generated using generic, standardised or idealised models. Patient-speciﬁc modelling ({PSM}) is almost never used for making clinical decisions. Imaging technologies have made it possible to create patient-speciﬁc geometries and {FE} meshes for modelling. While these have brought us closer to {PSM}, several challenges associated with the deﬁnition of material properties, loads, boundary conditions and interaction between components still need to be overcome. This study reviews the current status of {PSM} with respect to deﬁning material behaviour and prescribing boundary conditions and interactions. With regard to the constitutive modelling of bone, it is seen that imaging is being increasingly used to deﬁne elastic properties (isotropic as well as anisotropic). However, the post-elastic and time-dependent behaviour, important for several modelling situations, is mostly obtained from in vitro experiments. Strain-based plasticity, not commonly available in {FE} codes, appears to have the potential of reducing an element of patient-speciﬁcity in modelling the yielding behaviour of bone. {PSM} of real boundary conditions that include muscles and ligaments continues to remain a challenge; many clinically relevant questions can be, however, answered without their inclusion. Simulation techniques to undertake {PSM} of interactions between bone and uncemented implants are available. Interference ﬁt employed in both joint replacement fracture treatments induces considerable preload whose inclusion in models is important for the prediction of interface behaviour.
