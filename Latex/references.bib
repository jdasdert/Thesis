            Biomaterials play a significant role in revolutionizing human life in terms of implants and medical devices. These materials essentially need to be highly biocompatible and inert to the human physiological conditions. This paper provides an in-depth, critical and analytical review on the previous research work and studies conducted in the field of metals and alloys used as implant materials including stainless steel, titanium and its alloys, cobalt chromium and others. Since the manufacturing of medical implants relies on selected grades of biomaterials, metals play a significant role in biomaterials market. This paper focuses on highlighting some basic principles of manufacturing implant materials underlying composition, structure and properties of these materials. Finally, attention is also given to the role of these implant materials on the betterment of human life in terms of their failures by critically analysing these materials.},

	abstract = {Every year, many people suffer from bone fractures because of accidents or diseases. Majority of these fractures are too complicated to be treated with conventional medicine and must be mended surgically using non-degradable metal inserts. Such treatment may result in refusal and protection against stress, but may also require another surgical procedure to get rid of the metal inserts. Additionally, biodegradable metals that can readily erode inside the human body come with certain complications. These aspects prompted scientists to ﬁnd alternatives to metals. Some researchers began to focus on the ﬁeld of polymers which have shown signiﬁcant promise in replacing metals. In orthopaedics, degradable polymeric ﬁxation appliances are being studied to substitute metallic implants, eliminating stress protection and avoiding another implant removal surgery. The new generation of bioabsorbable and degradable polymeric implants are free from toxic and mutagenic effects. Nevertheless, these implants have several issues, including mechanical stiffness and strength limitations, unfavourable tissue responses, foreign body reactions, the late response of degraded tissue, and infection due to crystallinity and hydrophobicity. This review discusses the alternative synthetic polymer implant materials available that can be employed and their properties.},

Most previous studies consider a single implant thread design, an isotropic bone structure, and a static occlusal load. However, the effects of different thread designs, bone material properties, and loading conditions are important concerns in clinical practice. Accordingly, the present study performs Finite Element Analysis ({FEA}) simulations to investigate the static, quasi-static and dynamic response of the implant and implanted bone material under various thread designs and occlusal loading directions (buccal-lingual, mesiodistal and apical). The simulations focus speciﬁcally on the von Mises stress, displacement, shear stress, compressive stress, and tensile stress within the implant and the surrounding bone. The results show that the thread design and occlusal loading rate have a signiﬁcant effect on the stress distribution and deformation of the implant and bone structure during clinical applications. Overall, the results provide a useful insight into the design of enhanced dental implants for an improved load transfer efﬁciency and success rate.},

            The ability to replace or augment diseased body parts totally or partially has improved both the quality and life span of human population. The decline in surgical risks during recent decades has encouraged the development of more complex procedures for prosthetic implantation. Additionally, a variety of extracorporeal devices, such as the heart, lung and blood dialysis machines are used routinely, but these prosthetic elements have several limitations. Hence, research projects are currently underway to overcome the limitations of synthetic materials by developing formulations with varying properties, such as asymptomatic, long‐term function in the human physiological environment, etc., to meet the needs of biomedical surgeons. This review focuses on the several biomaterials corrosion and its measures to prevent corrosion.},

Till now a number of biomaterials have been discovered and due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability, these are biomaterials are employed significantly in biotherapy and medical science. On the basis of the source, these biomaterials can be grouped into two categories namely natural or synthetic polymers, henceforth they have paid much consideration.},

This new technology is increasingly being adopted in industry to improve the monitoring and efﬁciency of products and organizations. In healthcare, digital human twins ({DHTs}) represent virtual copies of patients, including tissues, organs, and physiological processes. Their application has the potential to transform patient care in the direction of increasingly personalized data-driven medicine. The use of {DHTs} can be integrated with digital twins of healthcare institutions to improve organizational management processes and resource allocation. By modeling the complex multi-omics interactions between genetic and environmental factors, {DHTs} help monitor disease progression and optimize treatment plans. Through digital simulation, {DHT} models enable the selection of the most appropriate molecular therapy and accurate 3D representation for precision surgical planning, together with augmented reality tools. Furthermore, they allow for the development of tailored early diagnosis protocols and new targeted drugs. Furthermore, digital twins can facilitate medical training and education. By creating virtual anatomy and physiology models, medical students can practice procedures, enhance their skills, and improve their understanding of the human body. Overall, digital twins have immense potential to revolutionize healthcare, improving patient care and outcomes, reducing costs, and enhancing medical research and education. However, challenges such as data security, data quality, and data interoperability must be addressed before the widespread adoption of digital twins in healthcare. We aim to propose a narrative review on this hot topic to provide an overview of the potential applications of digital twins to improve treatment and diagnostics, but also of the challenges related to their development and widespread diffusion.},

	abstract = {Bone replacement might have been practiced for centuries with various materials of natural origin, but had rarely met success until the late 19th century. Nowadays, many different bone substitutes can be used. They can be either derived from biological products such as demineralized bone matrix, platelet-rich plasma, hydroxyapatite, adjunction of growth factors (like bone morphogenetic protein) or synthetic such as calcium sulfate, tri-calcium phosphate ceramics, bioactive glasses, or polymer-based substitutes. All these substitutes are not suitable for every clinical use, and they have to be chosen selectively depending on their purpose. Thus, this review aims to highlight the principal characteristics of the most commonly used bone substitutes and to give some directions concerning their clinical use, as spine fusion, openwedge tibial osteotomy, long bone fracture, oral and maxillofacial surgery, or periodontal treatments. However, the main limitations to bone substitutes use remain the management of large defects and the lack of vascularization in their central part, which is likely to appear following their utilization. In the field of bone tissue engineering, developing porous synthetic substitutes able to support a faster and a wider vascularization within their structure seems to be a promising way of research.},

The use of cerclage wires to fix fractures was the most frequent fixation at this time. The French Berenger-Feraud (1832–1900) had written the first book on internal fixation. However internal fixation of fractures could not become a practical method before Lister had ensured the safety of open reduction and internal fixation in the treatment of fractures. Lister is not only the father of asepsis; he also used metal wires to fix even closed fractures. The first internal fixation by means of a plate and screws was described by Carl Hansmann in 1858 in Hamburg. Nevertheless, Arbuthnot Lane (1892) and Albin Lambotte (1905) are considered to be the founders of this method, which was further developed by Sherman in the first part of the 20th century.},

Corrosion is one of the major processes affecting the life and service of orthopaedic devices made of metals and alloys used as implants in the body. Among the metals and alloys known, stainless steels ({SS}), Co–Cr alloys and titanium and its alloys are the most widely used for the making of biodevices for extended life in human body. Incidences of failure of stainless steel implant devices reveal the occurrence of signiﬁcant localised corroding viz., pitting and crevice corrosion. Titanium forms a stable {TiO}2 ﬁlm which can release titanium particles under wear into the body environment. To reduce corrosion and achieve better biocompatibility, bulk alloying of stainless steels with titanium and nitrogen, surface alloying by ion implantation of stainless steels and titanium and its alloys, and surface modiﬁcation of stainless steel with bioceramic coatings are considered potential methods for improving the performance of orthopaedic devices. This review discusses these issues in depth and examines emerging directions.},

	abstract = {The topology optimization ({TO}) process has the objective to structurally optimize products in various industries, such as in biomechanical engineering. Additive manufacturing facilitates this procedure and enables the utility of advanced structures in order to achieve the optimal product design. Currently, orthopedic implants are fabricated from metal or metal alloys with totally solid structure to withstand the applied loads; nevertheless, such a practice reduces the compatibility with human tissues and increases the manufacturing cost as more feedstock material is needed. This article investigates the possibility of applying bioinspired lattice structures (cellular materials) in order to topologically optimize an orthopedic hip implant, made of Inconel 718 superalloy. Lattice structures enable topology optimization of an object by reducing its weight and increasing its porosity without compromising its mechanical behavior. Speciﬁcally, three diﬀerent bioinspired advanced lattice structures were investigated through ﬁnite element analysis ({FEA}) under in vivo loading. Furthermore, the regions with lattice structure were optimized through functional gradation of the cellular material. Results have shown that optimal design of hip implant geometry, in terms of stress behavior, was achieved through functionally graded lattice structures and the hip implant is capable of withstanding up to two times the in vivo loads, suggesting that this design is a suitable and eﬀective replacement for a solid implant.},

A ﬁxed bond between the bone and the implant was assumed, while the periodontal ligament was represented by means of three-dimensional nonlinear visco-elastic spring elements. Two different loading conditions were compared in the study: i) an axially directed static load of 50 kg that was applied to the tooth for 10 s, and ii) a transitional load of 50 kg that was applied for 5 milliseconds. Load duration appeared to have a greater inﬂuence than load intensity on the stress distribution in the bone around an implant and a rigidly connected tooth. Static load is, therefore, potentially more harmful for peri-implant bone than transitional load. The periodontal ligament seems to play a key role in the stress distribution between a tooth and a rigidly connected implant.},

	abstract = {In the past three decades, ﬁnite element ({FE}) modelling has provided considerable understanding to the area of musculoskeletal biomechanics. However, most of this understanding has been generated using generic, standardised or idealised models. Patient-speciﬁc modelling ({PSM}) is almost never used for making clinical decisions. Imaging technologies have made it possible to create patient-speciﬁc geometries and {FE} meshes for modelling. While these have brought us closer to {PSM}, several challenges associated with the deﬁnition of material properties, loads, boundary conditions and interaction between components still need to be overcome. This study reviews the current status of {PSM} with respect to deﬁning material behaviour and prescribing boundary conditions and interactions. With regard to the constitutive modelling of bone, it is seen that imaging is being increasingly used to deﬁne elastic properties (isotropic as well as anisotropic). However, the post-elastic and time-dependent behaviour, important for several modelling situations, is mostly obtained from in vitro experiments. Strain-based plasticity, not commonly available in {FE} codes, appears to have the potential of reducing an element of patient-speciﬁcity in modelling the yielding behaviour of bone. {PSM} of real boundary conditions that include muscles and ligaments continues to remain a challenge; many clinically relevant questions can be, however, answered without their inclusion. Simulation techniques to undertake {PSM} of interactions between bone and uncemented implants are available. Interference ﬁt employed in both joint replacement fracture treatments induces considerable preload whose inclusion in models is important for the prediction of interface behaviour.

Some of these materials are designed to degrade or to be resorbed inside the body rather than removing the implant after its function is served. Many properties such as mechanical properties, non-toxicity, surface modiﬁcation, degradation rate, biocompatibility, and corrosion rate and scaffold design are taken into consideration. The current review focuses on state-of-the-art biodegradable bioceramics, polymers, metal alloys and a few implants that employ bioresorbable/biodegradable materials.

Thepurposeofthissystematicreview wasto assess {theperformanceofAImodelsinimplantdentistry} for implant type recognition, implant success prediction by using patient risk factors and ontology criteria, and implant design optimization combining ﬁnite element analysis ({FEA}) calculations and {AI} models. Material and methods. An electronic systematic review was completed in 5 databases: {MEDLINE}/ {PubMed}, {EMBASE}, World of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus. A manual search was also conducted. Peerreviewed studies that developed {AI} models for implant type recognition, implant success prediction, and implant design optimization were included. The search strategy included articles published until February 21, 2021. Two investigators independently evaluated the quality of the studies by applying the Joanna Briggs Institute ({JBI}) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies (nonrandomized experimental studies). A third investigator was consulted to resolve lack of consensus.
Results. Seventeen articles were included: 7 investigations analyzed {AI} models for implant type recognition, 7 studies included {AI} prediction models for implant success forecast, and 3 studies evaluated {AI} models for optimization of implant designs. The {AI} models developed to recognize implant type by using periapical and panoramic images obtained an overall accuracy outcome ranging from 93.8\% to 98\%. The models to predict osteointegration success or implant success by using different input data varied among the studies, ranging from 62.4\% to 80.5\%. Finally, the studies that developed {AI} models to optimize implant designs seem to agree on the applicability of {AI} models to improve the design of dental implants. This improvement includes minimizing the stress at the implant-bone interface by 36.6\% compared with the ﬁnite element model; optimizing the implant design porosity, length, and diameter to improve the ﬁnite element calculations; or accurately determining the elastic modulus of the implant-bone interface.
Conclusions. {AI} models for implant type recognition, implant success prediction, and implant design optimization have demonstrated great potential but are still in development. Additional studies are indispensable to the further development and assessment of the clinical performance of {AI} models for those implant dentistry applications reviewed.

	abstract = {Total hip arthroplasty ({THA}) is most likely one of the most successful surgical procedures in medicine. It is estimated that three in four patients live beyond the ﬁrst post-operative year, so appropriate surgery is needed to alleviate an otherwise long-standing suboptimal functional level. However, research has shown that during a complete {THA} procedure, a solid hip implant inserted in the femur can damage the main arterial supply of the cortex and damage the medullary space, leading to cortical bone resorption. Therefore, this study aimed to design a porous hip implant with a focus on providing more space for better osteointegration, improving the medullary revascularisation and blood circulation of patients. Based on a review of the literature, a lightweight implant design was developed by applying topology optimisation and changing the materials of the implant. Gyroid and Voronoi lattice structures and a solid hip implant (as a control) were designed. In total, three designs of hip implants were constructed by using {SolidWorks} and {nTopology} software version 2.31. Point loads were applied at the x, y and z-axis to imitate the stance phase condition. The forces represented were x = 320 N, y = −170 N, and z = −2850 N. The materials that were used in this study were titanium alloys. All of the designs were then simulated by using Marc Mentat software version 2020 ({MSC} Software Corporation, Munich, Germany) via a ﬁnite element method. Analysis of the study on topology optimisation demonstrated that the Voronoi lattice structure yielded the lowest von Mises stress and displacement values, at 313.96 {MPa} and 1.50 mm, respectively, with titanium alloys as the materials. The results also indicate that porous hip implants have the potential to be implemented for hip implant replacement, whereby the mechanical integrity is still preserved. This result will not only help orthopaedic surgeons to justify the design choices, but could also provide new insights for future studies in biomechanics.},

            Biomaterials is an exciting and dynamic field, which uses a collection of diverse materials to achieve desired biological responses. While there is constant evolution and innovation in materials with time, biomaterials research has been hampered by the relatively long development period required. In recent years, driven by the need to accelerate materials development, the applications of machine learning in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds. The combination of machine learning with high‐throughput theoretical predictions and high‐throughput experiments ({HTE}) has shifted the traditional Edisonian (trial and error) paradigm to a data‐driven paradigm. In this review, each type of biomaterial and their key properties and use cases are systematically discussed, followed by how machine learning can be applied in the development and design process. The discussions are classified according to various types of materials used including polymers, metals, ceramics, and nanomaterials, and implants using additive manufacturing. Last, the current gaps and potential of machine learning to further aid biomaterials discovery and application are also discussed.},

            Biodegradable Mg‐based metals may be promising orthopedic implants for treating challenging bone diseases, attributed to their desirable mechanical and osteopromotive properties. This Review summarizes the current status and future research trends for Mg‐based orthopedic implants. First, the properties between Mg‐based implants and traditional orthopedic implants are compared on the following aspects: in vitro and in vivo degradation mechanisms of Mg‐based implants, peri‐implant bone responses, the fate of the degradation products, and the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of Mg ions on osteogenesis. Then, the preclinical studies conducted at the low weight bearing sites of animals are introduced. The innovative strategies (for example, via designing Mg‐containing hybrid systems) are discussed to address the limitations of Mg‐based metals prior to their clinical applications at weight‐bearing sites. Finally, the available clinical studies are summarized and the challenges and perspectives of Mg‐based orthopedic implants are discussed. Taken together, the progress made on the development of Mg‐based implants in basic, translational, and clinical research has laid down a foundation for developing a new era in the treatment of challenging and prevalent bone diseases.},

Material crystal plasticity corresponds to adif ferent irreversible process by which lattice rotates together with material lines between reference and intermediate configurations.Deformation twinning isan example of material plasticity.Acontinuu mmodel for mechanical twinning of single crystals ispresented inthis work. Twin formation is regarded as an unstable localization phenomenon, followed by twin front propagation. Finite element simulations are provided showing the twinning and untwinning of asingle crystal under cyclic loading, the development of twins at acrack tip, and lastly the formation of twin networks in acoating on an elastic substrate.},

            In the past couple of years, efforts have lead toward the convergence of two established software packages: Neper, developed primarily at {CNRS} and Mines Saint-Ã‰tienne, and {FEPX}, developed historically at the Deformation Process laboratory at Cornell University and (since 2020) at the Advanced Computational Materials Engineering Laboratory at the University of Alabama. The objective was to create an extensive and homogeneous ensemble for polycrystal plasticity studies that includes polycrystal generation and meshing, parallel finite-element crystal-plasticity simulation, post-processing and visualization. The two programs were upgraded to common standards, both in terms of usage and resources. Collectively, the project is under active development and distributed under free / open-source license (see both: https://neper.info, https://fepx.info).},

  abstract = {A finite-strain phase-field model of coupled deformation twinning and crystal plasticity is developed in the paper. Twinning is treated as a displacive transformation characterized by a volume-preserving stretch rather than a simple shear, the latter considered in the conventional approach. It is shown that the two approaches are equivalent in the sharp-interface description, but not in the diffuse-interface description. In the proposed stretch-based kinematics, each pair of conjugate twinning systems is represented by a single twin deformation variant, and thus a single order parameter suffices to consistently describe the two conjugate twinning systems, thereby treating them equally. The model is formulated in the framework of incremental energy minimization, which, upon time discretization, leads to a quasi-optimization problem due to the specific form of the incremental potential within the diffuse interfaces. To facilitate finite-element implementation, a micromorphic formulation of the model is employed. As an application, tensile twinning in {HCP} magnesium alloys is examined, and a set of comprehensive 2D plane-strain problems is studied to illustrate the features of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Particulate air pollution takes an enormous toll on society; it is linked to more than 3 million deaths annually. In addition, airborne microorganisms can spread dangerous diseases, compounding the issue. A widely used method for mitigating the risks of airborne particles is air ﬁltration. While effective at particle removal, conventional air ﬁlters typically lack additional functionalities. They cannot inactivate accumulated contaminants, and they require periodic replacement to remain safe. This work presents a multifunctional, self-cleaning air-ﬁltration system using a graphene-enhanced air ﬁlter medium ({GeFM}). The {GeFM} is capable of capturing {\textgreater}95\% of microorganisms and particles {\textgreater}1 mm and can be repeatedly joule heated to {\textgreater}300 C, regenerating the ﬁlter. Furthermore, the {GeFM} provides unique options for monitoring the airﬂow and loading status of the ﬁlter. The {GeFM} can improve ﬁlter lifetime and safety, offering great potential for the development of advanced and likely more sustainable air-ﬁltration solutions in the future.},

The driving force for diffusion is given by the gradient of the electrochemical potential.

Furthermore, considerable research was done to develop numerical models towards an inexpensive and fast designing tools capable of simulating the degradation/corrosion behavior of magnesium-based implants. Due to the complexity of the degradation process and the various factors that can be involved, several hypotheses were introduced to provide a realistic simulation of the corrosion behavior in vitro and in vivo.

Another outstanding property of the so-called theory of type {II} is the fact that the entropy ﬂux vector is determined by means of the same potential as the mechanical stress tensor. Motivated by the procedure of [9, 15], we formulate a variational formulation within the incremental framework for coupled thermoelasticity for type I mimicing type {II}. The entropy ﬂux of type {II} is determined via the free energy acting as a potential. This is not possible for the classical Fourier case in the continuous setting. Therefore, we target a derivation of an incremental entropy ﬂux following Fourier’s law by means of incremental potentials similar to the spirit of the theory of the non-dissipative Green–Naghditype {II}. Subsequently, we show that the resulting update algorithm is a convenient fully coupled ﬁnite element formulation of the proposed thermoelastic problem.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the thermomechanical coupling in dissipative materials. The focus lies on finite strain plasticity theory and the temperature increase resulting from plastic deformation. For this type of problem, two fundamentally different modeling approaches can be found in the literature: (a) models based on thermodynamical considerations and (b) models based on the so-called Taylor–Quinney factor. While a naive straightforward implementation of thermodynamically consistent approaches usually leads to an overprediction of the temperature increase due to plastic deformation, models relying on the Taylor–Quinney factor often violate fundamental physical principles such as the first and the second law of thermodynamics. In this paper, a thermodynamically consistent framework is elaborated which indeed allows the realistic prediction of the temperature evolution. In contrast to previously proposed frameworks, it is based on a fully threedimensional, finite strain setting and it naturally covers coupled isotropic and kinematic hardening — also based on non-associative evolution equations. Considering a variationally consistent description based on incremental energy minimization, it is shown that the aforementioned problem (thermodynamical consistency and a realistic temperature prediction) is essentially equivalent to correctly defining the decomposition of the total energy into stored and dissipative parts. Interestingly, this decomposition shows strong analogies to the Taylor–Quinney factor. In this respect, the Taylor–Quinney factor can be well motivated from a physical point of view. Furthermore, certain intervals for this factor can be derived in order to guarantee that fundamental physically principles are fulfilled a priori. Representative examples demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the final constitutive modeling framework.},

	abstract = {Modeling of the chemo-mechanical interactions between active particles in battery electrodes remains a largely unexplored research avenue. Of particular importance is modeling the local current densities which may vary across the surface of active particles under galvanostatic charging conditions. These depend on the local, stress-coupled electrochemical potential and may also be affected by mechanical degradation. In this work, we formulate and numerically implement a constitutive framework, which captures the complex chemo-mechanical multi-particle interactions in electrode microstructures, including the potential for mechanical degradation. A novel chemo-mechanical surface element is developed to capture the local non-linear reaction kinetics and concurrent potential for mechanical degradation. We specialize the proposed element to model the electrochemical behavior of two electrode designs of engineering relevance. First, we model a traditional liquid Li-ion battery electrode with a focus on chemical interactions. Second, we model a next generation all-solid-state composite cathode where mechanical interactions are particularly important. In modeling these electrodes, we demonstrate the manner in which the proposed simulation capability may be used to determine optimized electro-chemical and mechanical properties as well as the layout of the electrode microstructure, with a focus on minimizing mechanical degradation and improving electrochemical performance.},

With a view to modeling high-capacity composite electrode materials such as silicon or tin, the model accounts for ﬁnite deformations and plastic ﬂow, and models the evolving electrochemical boundary conditions resulting from the creation of new fracture surfaces using a cohesive zone. In addition, a simple mixed element is used to account for the driving force for diffusion arising from stress gradients. In this approach, the equations for diffusion and deformation are fully coupled, and can be integrated using a stable implicit time-stepping scheme.

	abstract = {Physics-based electrochemical battery models derived from porous electrode theory are a very powerful tool for understanding lithium-ion batteries, as well as for improving their design and management. Different model fidelity, and thus model complexity, is needed for different applications. For example, in battery design we can afford longer computational times and the use of powerful computers, while for real-time battery control (e.g. in electric vehicles) we need to perform very fast calculations using simple devices. For this reason, simplified models that retain most of the features at a lower computational cost are widely used. Even though in the literature we often find these simplified models posed independently, leading to inconsistencies between models, they can actually be derived from more complicated models using a unified and systematic framework. In this review, we showcase this reductive framework, starting from a high-fidelity microscale model and reducing it all the way down to the single particle model, deriving in the process other common models, such as the Doyle–Fuller–Newman model. We also provide a critical discussion on the advantages and shortcomings of each of the models, which can aid model selection for a particular application. Finally, we provide an overview of possible extensions to the models, with a special focus on thermal models. Any of these extensions could be incorporated into the microscale model and the reductive framework re-applied to lead to a new generation of simplified, multi-physics models.},

The intrinsic coupling arises from both stress-assisted diffusion in electrodes and ion mass ﬂux induced volumetric deformation. We demonstrate the theoretical modeling aspects and algorithmic performance through representative initial boundary value problems. The proposed ﬁnite strain theory is especially well suited for electrode materials like silicon which exhibit large volume changes during lithium insertion/ extraction.

	abstract = {A unifying thermomechanical framework is presented that reconciles several classes of gradient elastoviscoplasticity and damage models proposed in the literature during the last 40 years. It is based on the introduction of the micromorphic counterpart ␹␾ of a selected state or internal variable ␾ in a standard constitutive model. In addition to the classical balance of momentum equation, a balance of micromorphic momentum is derived that involves generalized stress tensors. The corresponding additional boundary conditions are also deduced from the procedure. The power of generalized forces is assumed to contribute to the energy balance equation. The free energy density function is then chosen to depend on a relative generalized strain, typically ␾-␹␾, and the microstrain gradient ١␹␾. When applied to the deformation gradient itself, ␾ ϵ F{\textgreater} , the method yields the micromorphic theory of Eringen and Mindlin together with its extension to ﬁnite deformation elastoviscoplasticity by Forest and Sievert. If the selected variable is the cumulative plastic strain, the theory reduces to the so-called “nonlocal implicit gradient-enhanced elastoplasticity model” by Engelen, Geers, and Peerlings, provided that simpliﬁed linear relationships are adopted between generalized stresses and strains. The same holds if the micromorphic variable coincides with a microdamage variable. If the internal constraint is introduced that the micromorphic variable ␹␾ remains as close as possible to the macroscopic variable ␾, the micromorphic model reduces to the second gradient or gradient of internal variable approach as deﬁned by Maugin. If the selected variable is the cumulative plastic strain or the full plastic strain tensor, the constrained micromorphic theory delivers Aifantis-like strain gradient plasticity models. The advantage of the micromorphic approach is that it provides the generalized balance equation under nonisothermal conditions and offers the setting for anisotropic nonlinear constitutive relations between generalized stress and strains in contrast to most existing models. In rate-independent plasticity, it is shown that there is generally no need for a variational formulation of the yield condition.},

Modeling can therefore play a very valuable role in the design and lifetime prediction of energy storage materials and devices. Batteries are inherently multi-scale, in space and time. The macrostructural characteristic lengths (the thickness of a single cell, for instance) are order of magnitudes larger than the particles that form the microstructure of the porous electrodes, which in turn are scale-separated from interface layers at which atomistic intercalations occur. Multi-physics modeling concepts, methodologies, and simulations at different scales, as well as scale transition strategies proposed in the recent literature are here revised.

	abstract = {The paper presents a constitutive framework for solids with dissipative micro-structures based on compact variational statements. It develops incremental minimization and saddle point principles for a class of gradient-type dissipative materials which incorporate micro-structural ﬁelds (micro-displacements, order parameters, or generalized internal variables), whose gradients enter the energy storage and dissipation functions. In contrast to classical local continuum approaches to inelastic solids based on locally evolving internal variables, these global micro-structural ﬁelds are governed by additional balance equations including micro-structural boundary conditions. They describe changes of the substructure of the material which evolve relatively to the material as a whole. Typical examples are theories of phase ﬁeld evolution, gradient damage, or strain gradient plasticity. Such models incorporate non-local effects based on length scales, which reﬂect properties of the material micro-structure. We outline a uniﬁed framework for the broad class of ﬁrst-order gradient-type standard dissipative solids. Particular emphasis is put on alternative multi-ﬁeld representations, where both the microstructural variable itself as well as its dual driving force are present. These three-ﬁeld settings are suitable for models with threshold- or yield-functions formulated in the space of the driving forces. It is shown that the coupled macro- and micro-balances follow in a natural way as the Euler equations of minimization and saddle point principles, which are based on properly deﬁned incremental potentials. These multi-ﬁeld potential functionals are outlined in both a continuous rate formulation and a time–space-discrete incremental setting. The inherent symmetry of the proposed multi-ﬁeld formulations is an attractive feature with regard to their numerical implementation. The uniﬁed character of the framework is demonstrated by a spectrum of model problems, which covers phase ﬁeld models and formulations of gradient damage and plasticity.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a general framework for the macroscopic, continuum-based formulation and numerical implementation of dissipative functional materials with electro-magneto-mechanical couplings based on incremental variational principles. We focus on quasi-static problems, where mechanical inertia effects and time-dependent electro-magnetic couplings are a priori neglected and a time-dependence enters the formulation only through a possible rate-dependent dissipative material response. The underlying variational structure of non-reversible coupled processes is related to a canonical constitutive modeling approach, often addressed to so-called standard dissipative materials. It is shown to have enormous consequences with respect to all aspects of the continuum-based modeling in macroscopic electro-magnetomechanics. At ﬁrst, the local constitutive modeling of the coupled dissipative response, i.e. stress, electric and magnetic ﬁelds versus strain, electric displacement and magnetic induction, is shown to be variational based, governed by incremental minimization and saddle-point principles. Next, the implications on the formulation of boundary-value problems are addressed, which appear in energy-based formulations as minimization principles and in enthalpy-based formulations in the form of saddle-point principles. Furthermore, the material stability of dissipative electro-magneto-mechanics on the macroscopic level is deﬁned based on the convexity/concavity of incremental potentials. We provide a comprehensive outline of alternative variational structures and discuss details of their computational implementation, such as formulation of constitutive update algorithms and ﬁnite element solvers. From the viewpoint of constitutive modeling, including the understanding of the stability in coupled electro-magneto-mechanics, an energy-based formulation is shown to be the canonical setting. From the viewpoint of the computational convenience, an enthalpy-based formulation is the most convenient setting. A numerical investigation of a multiferroic composite demonstrates perspectives of the proposed framework with regard to the future design of new functional materials.

	abstract = {We show that the coupled balance equations for a large class of dissipative materials can be cast in the form of {GENERIC} (General Equations for Non-Equilibrium Reversible Irreversible Coupling). In dissipative solids (generalized standard materials), the state of a material point is described by dissipative internal variables in addition to the elastic deformation and the temperature. The framework {GENERIC} allows for an efﬁcient derivation of thermodynamically consistent coupled ﬁeld equations, while revealing additional underlying physical structures, like the role of the free energy as the driving potential for reversible effects and the role of the free entropy (Massieu potential) as the driving potential for dissipative effects. Applications to large and small-strain thermoplasticity are given. Moreover, for the quasistatic case, where the deformation can be statically eliminated, we derive a generalized gradient structure for the internal variable and the temperature with a reduced entropy as driving functional.},

	abstract = {A chemo-mechanical model for a finite-strain elasto-viscoplastic material containing multiple chemical components is formulated and an efficient numerical implementation is developed to solve the resulting transport relations. The numerical solution relies on inverting the constitutive model for the chemical potential. In this work, a semi-analytical inversion for a general family of multi-component regular-solution chemical free energy models is derived. This is based on splitting the chemical free energy into a convex contribution, treated implicitly, and a non-convex contribution, treated explicitly. This results in a reformulation of the system transport equations in terms of the chemical potential rather than the composition as the independent field variable. The numerical conditioning of the reformulated system, discretised by finite elements, is shown to be significantly improved, and convergence to the Cahn–Hilliard solution is demonstrated for the case of binary spinodal decomposition. Chemo-mechanically coupled binary and ternary spinodal decomposition systems are then investigated to illustrate the effect of anisotropic elastic deformation and plastic relaxation of the resulting spinodal morphologies in more complex material systems.},

The variational theory results in precise predictions of the rate of heating due to dissipation and does not require an a priori deﬁnition or model of a fraction of plastic work converted to heat. We show that the predicted heat-to-plastic work ratios are in good agreement with experimental observations for 2024-T3 aluminum, a-titanium and pure polycrystalline tantalum, including their evolution with strain and their dependence on strain-rate. We also critically compare the variational theory to other theories and models in the literature.},

In this contribution, a material model is presented which enables computational simulations and structural optimization of solid multi-component systems. Typical Systems of this kind are anodes in batteries, reactive polymer blends and propellants. The physical processes which are assumed to contribute to the microstructural evolution are: (i) particle exchange and mechanical deformation; (ii) spinodal decomposition and phase coarsening; (iii) chemical reactions between the components; and (iv) energetic forces associated with the elastic field of the solid. To illustrate the capability of the deduced coupled field model, three-dimensional Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline ({NURBS}) based finite element simulations of such multi-component structures are presented.},

	abstract = {Thermal and mechanical effects play a vital role in determining the electrochemical behavior of lithium-ion batteries ({LIBs}). Non-uniform temperature distribution and mechanical deformation can result in uneven electrochemical states, leading to spatially varying aging rates that significantly shorten cell lifetime. In order to improve simulation accuracy and thus the quality of computational battery design optimization, it is therefore essential to capture these coupled phenomena in a simulation model of a full battery cell. In this work, an electro-chemo-thermo-mechanical coupled framework is proposed to simulate {LIBs} in the three-dimensional space. In this new framework, a recently proposed one-dimensional electrochemical model, which includes the impact of mechanical deformation and local lithiation state on the effective transport properties of the charged species, is coupled with a three-dimensional thermomechanical model. A unique coupling scheme is proposed to handle information exchange between these two models. This framework allows us to accurately and efficiently study the behavior of three-dimensional cells with realistic geometry and resolve the spatial variation of interested fields. Two commercial cells are studied to show the performance of the newly proposed battery simulation framework.},

In the last decade, numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to investigate and model these phenomena. This review aims, on one hand, at a comprehensive overview of the approaches for modeling the coupled chemo-mechanical behavior of {LIBs} at three diﬀerent scales, namely the particle, the electrode, and the battery cell levels. Focus is thereby the impact of mechanics on the cell performance and the degradation mechanisms. We point out the critical points in these models, as well as the challenges towards resolving them. Particularly, by outlining the milestones of theoretical and numerical models, we give a step-by-step instruction to the interested readers in both electrochemical and mechanical communities. On the other hand, this review aims to facilitate the knowledge transfer of mechanically coupled modeling to the study of all-solid-state batteries, where the mechanical issues are expected to play even more diverse and essential roles due to the additional mechanical constraintimposed by the solid electrolytes.},
