	abstract = {Biomaterials have been used tremendously in medical science over last many decades. In human body a number of body tissues like teeth, ligament, bones tendons and others have been successfully replaced by these biomaterials. In present scenario the various applications of these biomaterials are still awaited. The most important challenge in using these biomaterials is immune rejection because in current situation the lifetime implants and bone replacement must required biocompatibility along with the biological and mechanical characteristics of the biomaterial used. Till now a number of biomaterials have been discovered and due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability, these are biomaterials are employed significantly in biotherapy and medical science. On the basis of the source, these biomaterials can be grouped into two categories namely natural or synthetic polymers, henceforth they have paid much consideration.},
