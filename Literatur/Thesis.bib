	abstract = {Particulate air pollution takes an enormous toll on society; it is linked to more than 3 million deaths annually. In addition, airborne microorganisms can spread dangerous diseases, compounding the issue. A widely used method for mitigating the risks of airborne particles is air ﬁltration. While effective at particle removal, conventional air ﬁlters typically lack additional functionalities. They cannot inactivate accumulated contaminants, and they require periodic replacement to remain safe. This work presents a multifunctional, self-cleaning air-ﬁltration system using a graphene-enhanced air ﬁlter medium ({GeFM}). The {GeFM} is capable of capturing {\textgreater}95\% of microorganisms and particles {\textgreater}1 mm and can be repeatedly joule heated to {\textgreater}300 C, regenerating the ﬁlter. Furthermore, the {GeFM} provides unique options for monitoring the airﬂow and loading status of the ﬁlter. The {GeFM} can improve ﬁlter lifetime and safety, offering great potential for the development of advanced and likely more sustainable air-ﬁltration solutions in the future.},
